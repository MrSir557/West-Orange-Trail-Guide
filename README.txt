This solo project was for my Spring 2023 DIG 2000 final, which required us to make a web page about something in our community. I created an interactive map of the West Orange Trail, detailing stops along the trail. HTML5 and CSS were used, and skills such as implementing hyperlinks, attaching links to images and formatting images and text. It also taught me design skills such as what colors and fonts to use, where to place images on a page, and what the most vital information to include in a website is.
